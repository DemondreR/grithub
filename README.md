# GritHub

GritHub is a Groovy wrapper for the [GitHub Java API](https://github.com/kohsuke/github-api) from Kohsuke Kawaguchi,
made as an illustration of various runtime metaprogramming techniques for Groovy.

It is not supposed to be used in production but as support for the [talk](http://t.co/9Z8cAdausE).
